Software engineer who enjoys working with a variety of different languages, but my bread and butter has always been Java and C#.  I am always looking for something new to learn from Scheme and build systems like gradle and msbuild to revision control systems like GIT and SVN.  I really just wanted a place on the web where I can capture notes, tips and tricks that I learned over the years.  If I happen to help other people along the way than that makes it even better.  Also, I needed a place where I could link my [Master's Thesis](/public/about/thesis.pdf)!
